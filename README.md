# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
Analyzing ride share data for a fictional company "PyBer". Then creating charts to visualize the data using the Matplotlib library. Steps included:
  - Creating a bubble chart for ride-sharing data.
  - Calculating summary statistics for the ride-sharing data.
  - Creating a pie chart to visualize the percentage of total fares by city type (city types: Urban, Suburban, Rural).
  - Creating a pie chart to visualize the percentage of total rides by city type.
  - Creating a pie chart to visualize the percentage of total drivers by city type.
  
## Challenge
The challenge for this module involved creating three deliverables. They are:
  - A DataFrame summarizing the key metrics for ride-sharing data by city type (in the PyBer.ipynb file)
  - A multiple-line chart, with one line for each city type, that shows the sum of fares for each week (Total_Fare_by_City_Type.png in the     analysis folder).
  - A written report of the results (this starts below under "Challenge Summary").
